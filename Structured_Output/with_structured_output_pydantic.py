text = """I have been using the Dell Inspiron 15 3000 for over 3 years, and the experience has been disappointing. The look is attractive, but the performance is subpar.
From the very first year, I started facing hardware issues. The touchpad rarely works properly, and the display 
unexpectedly tore within just 6 months of purchase. The RAM is insufficient, lag is noticeable in daily tasks, 
and storage quickly became a major issue. Even after attempting upgrades, the performance did not improve much. 

The worst part is the battery life â€” it barely lasts 1 hour even with battery saver on, otherwise it drains even faster. 
This makes the laptop almost unusable for long sessions without being plugged in. 

Pros:
- Looks good
- Affordable price
- Keyboard is comfortable
- Decent for office work

Cons:
- Touchpad frequently fails
- Display tore within 6 months
- Insufficient RAM
- Frequent lag
- Storage limitations
- Upgrades do not improve performance
- Battery lasts only 1 hour
- Bad choice for memory intensive tasks
- Overheats quickly
